# Abilities System Description

## Overview
The Abilities System is designed to manage and control user permissions and capabilities within the application. It provides a flexible way to define what actions users can perform based on their roles, ranks, and specific conditions.

## Core Components

### 1. Abilities
- Discrete permissions or capabilities that can be granted to users
- Each ability represents a specific action or access right
- Abilities can be conditional based on context

### 2. Ability Groups
- Logical groupings of related abilities
- Helps organize and manage abilities more effectively
- Makes it easier to assign sets of related permissions

### 3. Ability Assignments
- Links between users/roles and their granted abilities
- Can be direct (user-to-ability) or indirect (role-to-ability)
- Supports inheritance and hierarchical permission structures

## Key Features

### 1. Conditional Permissions
- Abilities can be context-aware
- Permissions can vary based on:
  - User attributes
  - Resource ownership
  - Time-based conditions
  - Custom business rules

### 2. Hierarchical Structure
- Supports nested permission inheritance
- Lower-level permissions can override higher-level ones
- Flexible permission propagation rules

### 3. Audit Trail
- Tracks ability assignments and changes
- Records when and why permissions were granted/revoked
- Supports compliance and security requirements

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Ability Definition
- Each ability should be clearly defined
- Include scope and limitations
- Document any dependencies or prerequisites

### 2. Access Control
- Use declarative syntax for permission checks
- Support both simple and complex authorization rules
- Provide efficient caching mechanisms

### 3. Security Considerations
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Regular security audits
- Protected ability management endpoints

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Permission Check
